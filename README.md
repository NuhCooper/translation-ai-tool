# Survey Translation AI Tool

This project provides a simple, lightweight AI-powered solution for translating short survey questions into multiple languages. It demonstrates how pre-trained neural machine translation models can support faster localisation workflows in a business context.

## Features

 - Uses Hugging Face MarianMT models for neural machine translation (NMT)

 - Supports multiple language pairs (e.g., English to French, German, Spanish)

 - Simple, interactive user interface built with Gradio

 - Deployable as a public web app on Hugging Face Spaces

 - Designed for quick extension with additional languages as needed

## File Structure

 - app.py - Contains the Gradio app logic and translation pipeline.

 - requirements.txt - Lists the Python dependencies.

 - README.md - Project overview and usage instructions.
